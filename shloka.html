        <p>1. Shloka 2.48 (Chapter 2, Verse 48)</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(210, 245, 11);"> In Sanskrit:<br>
            योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय।<br>

            सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते।।</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):</p>
        <p> Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna.<br> Perform your duty and abandon all
            attachments to success or failure.<br> Such
            evenness of mind is called yoga.</p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>In this shloka, Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duties with an evenness of mind, without getting
            attached to the outcome. He emphasizes the importance of detachment and encourages Arjuna to focus on the
            present moment and the task at hand, rather than worrying about the future or regretting the past.

            By doing so, one can achieve a state of balance and equanimity, which is the ultimate goal of yoga. This
            shloka
            from Bhagavad Gita teaches us the importance of being focused and present in our actions, and not getting
            bogged
            down by the fear of failure or the desire for success.</p>

            तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम्।<br>

            स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा।।</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            Let it be known: the severance from the union-with-pain is YOGA.<br> This YOGA should be practised with
            determination and with a mind steady and undespairing.<br>

        </p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>From this Bhagavad Gita verse, we can learn the importance of equanimity in life and how it can lead to a
            peaceful mind. We can also learn that achieving a steady and focused mind is not easy and requires practice
            and
            dedication. It teaches us the need to strive for inner balance and that it can be attained through the
            practice
            of yoga and meditation.</p>

            In Sanskrit:<br>
            मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु ।<br>

            मामेवैष्यसि सत्यं ते प्रतिजाने प्रियोऽसि मे ॥</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me.<br> Thus you will come to Me
            without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.<br>
        </p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>It is one of the most important Bhagavad Gita slokas that shows us the importance of devotion to God and the
            power of meditation in achieving spiritual unity with the Divine.

            It teaches us that by focusing our mind on God, surrendering to Him, and practicing devotion, we can achieve
            the
            ultimate goal of realizing our true self and attaining union with God.

            The shloka highlights the significance of seeking refuge in God, offering our actions to Him, and making Him
            the
            center of our lives. We can also learn that the ultimate goal of human life is to attain a higher spiritual
            consciousness and to merge with the Divine.</p>

            In Sanskrit:<br>
            न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते।<br>

            तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति॥</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            In this world, there is nothing so purifying as knowledge. <br>One who has attained perfection in yoga, finds it
            within himself in due course of time.<br>

        </p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>As one of the best slokas from Bhagavad Gita, it teaches us that knowledge is the most powerful tool for
            purifying oneself. It is through knowledge that one can overcome ignorance and attain enlightenment.

            Yoga is a means to attain knowledge and self-realization. Through the practice of yoga, one can achieve a
            state
            of union with the divine and discover the true nature of the self.

            It also tells us that the path to self-realization is not easy and requires time, effort, and dedication.

            It is a gradual process that requires patience and perseverance. Moreover, self-realization is not something
            that can be attained through external means. It is a journey of self-discovery that takes place within
            oneself.

            कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम्‌ ॥</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible,<br> unborn, eternal and immutable, kill
            anyone
            or cause anyone to kill?
        </p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>The lesson from this Bhagavad Gita verse is that the true self, the soul, is eternal and indestructible. It
            cannot be killed, nor can it kill. It is the body that is mortal and subject to birth and death.

            Therefore, we should not be attached to the physical body and should not cause harm to others or ourselves.
            This
            shloka teaches us to recognize the true nature of ourselves and others, and to act with compassion and
            wisdom.

            ज्ञानेन तु तदज्ञानं येषां नाशितमात्मनः ।<br>

            O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible,<br> unborn, eternal and immutable, kill
            anyone or cause anyone to kill?<br>
        </p>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>In the list of best Bhagavad Gita quotes, this verse teaches us that true spiritual wisdom lies in
            surrendering
            to the divine, and recognizing that the true Self or Atman resides within all beings. By surrendering all
            actions to the divine, one can attain a state of true yoga or union with the divine.

            This state of surrender and union leads to freedom from doubts, false ego, and other limitations of the
            material
            world.</p>

        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress,<br> and their disappearance in due
            course,<br>
            are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.<br> They arise from sense perception, O
            scion of Bharata, <br>and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.
        </p>

        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>The Bhagavad Gita shloka 2.14 teaches us the impermanence of happiness and<br> distress in life and how they are
            like
            the changing seasons of winter and summer.<br>

            Just like how winter and summer come and go, happiness and distress also arise and disappear in due course.
            Therefore, we should learn to accept both happiness and distress with equanimity and not let them disturb
            our
            inner peace.

            We should cultivate the ability to tolerate the ups and downs of life without being overwhelmed by them.
            This
            requires a sense of detachment and a deep understanding that everything in life is temporary and fleeting.
            By
            cultivating this attitude, we can remain peaceful and steady in the face of life’s challenges.</p>

            तत्र श्रीर्विजयो भूतिर्ध्रुवा नीतिर्मतिर्मम।।</p>
        <p>Translation (Meaning in English):<br>
            Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, <br>there
            will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.
        </p><br>
        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>As one of the best Bhagavad Gita slokas, this verse teaches us that with the presence of God and the guidance
            of a true guru or teacher, one can achieve success, prosperity, and moral strength.

            It highlights the importance of having a righteous guide or mentor to lead one towards the right path and
            help overcome challenges in life. Moreover, this verse emphasizes that true victory and prosperity come from
            righteousness and morality and that the divine presence can guide and lead one towards this path of
            righteousness.

        <p>What we learn:</p>
        <p>You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never

            By doing so, we can attain a state of inner peace and calmness, and ultimately achieve the highest goal of
